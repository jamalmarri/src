These are the main tools you should need for building and installing kernels on arm. They're not particularly robust, but they should work for the relatively simple workflow we're using. I've used all the commands, but I haven't tried these scripts, so you may need to do some troublshooting if you use these scripts, or you can just reference them figure out the commands you need to build and install a kernel.
